	abstract = {In this paper, a simplified thermal lattice Boltzmann method (STLBM) without evolution of the distribution functions is developed for simulating incompressible thermal flows. With the assistance of the fractional step technique, the macroscopic governing equations recovered from Chapman{\textendash}Enskog (C{\textendash}E) expansion analysis are resolved through a predictor{\textendash}corrector scheme. Then in both the predictor and corrector steps, using the isentropic properties of lattice tensors and relationships of C{\textendash}E analysis, the macroscopic flow variables are explicitly calculated from the equilibrium and non-equilibrium distribution functions. In STLBM, the equilibrium distribution functions are calculated from the macroscopic variables, while the non-equilibrium distribution functions are evaluated from the differences between two equilibrium distribution functions at different locations and time levels. Therefore, STLBM directly updates the macroscopic variables during the computational process, which lowers the virtual memory cost and facilitates the implementation of physical boundary conditions. Through von Neumann stability analysis, the present method is proven to be unconditionally stable, which is further validated by numerical tests. Three representative examples are presented to demonstrate the robustness of STLBM in practical simulations and its flexibility on different types of meshes and boundaries.},

	abstract = {Effects of wettability on saturated pool boiling heat transfer from a smooth superheated substrate, with a finite thickness at constant wall temperatures at the bottom, are investigated based on a recently developed liquid{\textendash}vapor phase-change lattice Boltzmann method. For a hydrophilic surface, it is shown that bubble departure diameter and bubble departure frequency increase with the increase of contact angle and superheat, and the whole bubble departs from the surface with a waiting period in the ebullition cycle. A microlayer of liquid exists between the bubble and the heated hydrophilic surface and this region exhibits a high local heat flux during bubble growth period. On the other hand, a residual bubble will be left on the surface when bubble departs from a hydrophobic surface and hence no waiting period exists. No microlayer exists on the heated hydrophobic surface, and the three-phase contact line region has the highest local heat flux and lowest local temperature. Time histories of the wall temperature on the top of a hydrophilic substrate and a hydrophobic substrate as well as the associated heat flux are studied in details during the nucleate boiling process. Effects of wettability, superheat and heater size on number of nucleation sites in saturated pool boiling are investigated. Saturated boiling curves (from onset of nucleate boiling to critical heat flux, to transition boiling to stable film boiling) for hydrophilic and hydrophobic heating surfaces are obtained by numerical simulation for the first time.},

It is a direct numerical simulation of boiling heat transfer determined by the local temperature and thermodynamic relation given by the equation of state. By using a smaller value of a in the P-R equation of state, a thicker liquid-vapor interface is formed and a better numerical stability at a large liquid/vapor density ratio is obtained. Furthermore, the conjugated boundary of heated plate and fluids is specially dealt with to avoid the rapid change of heat flux at the interface. The boiling heat transfer at a density ratio around 200 can be simulated. The results show that: the boiling heat flux decreases during the bubble expansion process while increases during the rewetting process; the average heat flux of boiling at Ts {\textonequarter} 0.68Tc is much larger than that at Ts {\textonequarter} 0.86Tc; bubble occurs earlier on a hydrophobic surface than a hydrophilic one; there exists a remained vapor on a hydrophobic surface after bubble departure, while it is not observed for hydrophilic surface; for the simulated boiling curve, the maximum (critical) heat flux decreases with the decreasing wettability of surfaces; there exists an optimal width of the rectangular cavity making the best heat transfer performance of surfaces; in this study, the roughness surface with a circle cavity has the best heat transfer performance.},

	abstract = {"This book presents basic optimization principles and gradient-based algorithms to a general audience, in a brief and easy-to-read form without neglecting rigour. The work should enable the professional to apply optimization theory and algorithms to his own particular practical field of interest, be it engineering, physics, chemistry, or business economics. Most importantly, for the first time in a relatively brief and introductory work, due attention is paid to the difficulties - such as noise, discontinuities, expense of function evaluations, and the existence of multiple minima - that often unnecessarily inhibit the use of gradient-based methods. In a separate chapter on new gradient-based methods developed by the author and his coworkers, it is shown how these difficulties may be overcome without losing the desirable features of classical gradient-based methods." "It is intended that this book be used in senior- to graduate-level semester courses in optimization, as offered in mathematics, engineering, computer science, and operations research departments, and also to be useful to practising professionals in the workplace."--Jacket.},

	abstract = {Energy-conserving methods have recently gained popularity for the spatial discretization of the incompressible Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations. In this paper implicit Runge{\textendash}Kutta methods are investigated which keep this property when integrating in time. Firstly, a number of energy-conserving Runge{\textendash}Kutta methods based on Gauss, Radau and Lobatto quadrature are constructed. These methods are suitable for convection-dominated problems (such as turbulent flows), because they do not introduce artificial diffusion and are stable for any time step. Secondly, to obtain robust time-integration methods that work also for stiff problems, the energy-conserving methods are extended to a new class of additive Runge{\textendash}Kutta methods, which combine energy conservation with L-stability. In this class, the Radau IIA/B method has the best properties. Results for a number of test cases on two-stage methods indicate that for pure convection problems the additive Radau IIA/B method is competitive with the Gauss methods. However, for stiff problems, such as convection-dominated flows with thin boundary layers, both the higher order Gauss and Radau IIA/B method suffer from order reduction. Overall, the Gauss methods are the preferred method for energy-conserving time integration of the incompressible Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations.},

	abstract = {In the past the development of kinetic energy conserving finite-difference methods mostly focused on second-order accurate central methods defined on uniform grids. Nowadays the need for high-order accurate discretizations, to perform for instance accurate numerical simulations of turbulent flow, calls for the development of novel kinetic energy conserving discretization schemes. Instead of choosing a fixed basis discretization up front, in this paper a different, more general, approach is applied. For a Cartesian mesh, sets of conditions are presented such that all discretizations of the linear or non-linear convection equation which obey these conditions, unconditionally conserve kinetic energy.

For the linear convection equation it is shown that on a uniform grid it is necessary and sufficient for a discretization to be central in order to be fully conservative, that is: such discretizations not only unconditionally conserve kinetic energy but also unconditionally conserve momentum. On non-uniform grids an algorithm is introduced that can be used to generate fully conservative discretizations that are at least first-order accurate.

The derivation of the discretization conditions for the non-linear convection equation is performed in the two-dimensional (2D) linear case. Some examples on uniform grids and on non-uniform grids are presented. It is shown that on uniform grids no upper limit exists with respect to the accuracy of the kinetic energy conserving method. For the higher-dimensional linear and non-linear convection equation the same set of conditions, which ensure the unconditional conservation of kinetic energy, are found as in the 2D linear case. Other results too are found to be straightforward generalizations of the corresponding 2D linear results.

It is shown that the fourth-order unconditionally kinetic energy conserving discretization on a staggered mesh introduced in this paper is well suited to simulate the initial development of an inviscid shear layer instability in a divergence-free flow.},

	abstract = {The IAEA's gas-cooled reactor program has coordinated international cooperation for an evaluation of a high temperature gas-cooled reactor's performance, which includes a validation of the physics analysis codes and the performance models for the proposed GT-MHR. This benchmark problem consists of the pin and block calculations and the reactor physics of the control rod worth for the GT-MHR with a weapon grade plutonium fuel. Benchmark analysis has been performed by using the HELIOS/MASTER deterministic code package and the MCNP Monte Carlo code. The deterministic code package adopts a conventional 2-step procedure in which a few group constants are generated by a transport lattice calculation, and the reactor physics analysis is performed by a 3-dimensional diffusion calculation. In order to solve particular modeling issues in GT-MHR, recently developed technologies were utilized and new analysis procedure was devised. Double heterogeneity effect could be covered by using the reactivity-equivalent physical transformation (RPT) method. Strong core{\textendash}reflector interaction could be resolved by applying an equivalence theory to the generation of the reflector cross sections. In order to accurately handle with very large control rods which are asymmetrically located in a fuel and a reflector block, the surface dependent discontinuity factors (SDFs) were considered in applying an equivalence theory. A new method has been devised to consider SDFs without any modification of the nodal solver in MASTER. All computational results of the HELIOS/MASTER code package were compared with those of MCNP. The multiplication factors of HELIOS for the pin cells are in very good agreement with those of MCNP to within a maximum error of 693 pcm $\Delta$$\rho$. The maximum differences of the multiplication factors for the fuel blocks are about 457 pcm $\Delta$$\rho$ and the control rod worths of HELIOS are consistent with those of MCNP to within a maximum error of 3.09\%. On considering a SDF in the core calculations, the maximum differences of the control rod worths are significantly decreased to be 7.7\% from 21.5\%. It is showed that there are good consistencies between the deterministic code package and the Monte Carlo code from the results of these benchmark calculations. Therefore, the HELIOS/MASTER 2-step procedure can be used as a standard reactor physics analysis tool for a prismatic VHTR.},

	abstract = {Many energy conversion and other thermal-fluid systems exhibit unsteady convective heat exchange. In such systems, generic spatiotemporal variations in the flow give rise to variations in the heat flux for a given fluid{\textendash}solid temperature difference, which can be interpreted as spatiotemporal fluctuations of the instantaneous heat transfer coefficient. These variations can lead to unsteady conjugate heat transfer, in which the exchanged heat flux arises from an interaction between the bulk fluid temperature and the temperature in the solid. Further, the nonlinear coupling between the fluctuating temperature differences and the heat transfer coefficient can lead to an effect we refer to as augmentation, which quantitatively describes the ability of a particular arrangement to have a different time-mean heat flux from the product between the mean heat transfer coefficient and the mean temperature difference across the fluid. It is important to be able to understand and to model in a simple framework the effects of the material properties, the geometry and the character of the heat transfer coefficient on the thermal response of the fluid{\textendash}solid system, and consequently to predict the overall heat transfer performance of these systems. This paper, which follows on from its predecessor [1], is concerned with the phenomenon of augmentation in simple, one-dimensional, unsteady and conjugate fluid{\textendash}solid systems. A simple semi-analytical one-dimensional model of heat transfer with a time-varying heat transfer coefficient, which was presented in Mathie and Markides [1], is applied herein to two different paradigm problems. Such a model can be an important tool in the design of improved heat exchangers and thermal insulation, through for example, the novel selection of materials to exploit these augmentation effects. The first flow considered is a thin, wavy fluid film flowing over a heated plate. This film flow exhibits a periodic fluctuation in the heat transfer coefficient, that is linked to the wavy interfacial deformations of free surface of the liquid film. The second flow considered concerns the heat transfer behind a backwards-facing step, which exhibits broadband fluctuations in the heat transfer coefficient due to the flow separation and turbulence behind the step. The model predictions of the augmentation ratio for these problems are also compared to direct measurements from each case. Good agreement is observed with the experimental results for the global heat transfer trends. In both cases the augmentation ratio was negative, reflecting a reduction in time-averaged heat transfer. For the backwards-facing step flow a low magnitude of augmentation ratio was observed, however, the thin film flows exhibited augmentation ratios of as high as 10\%.},

This generalization is achieved by preserving symmetries of the uniform mesh case. The proposed schemes do not simultaneously conserve mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. However, depending on the form of the convective term, conservation of either momentum or energy in addition to mass can be achieved. It is shown that the conservation properties of the generalized schemes are as good as those of the standard second order finite difference scheme on non-uniform meshes, while the accuracy of the new schemes is definitely superior.

The new ADI finite-volume method is also extended for simulations on multi-block structured curvilinear grids with which complex geometries can be efficiently resolved. The numerical method is first developed for an unsteady convection{\textendash}diffusion equation, then is extended for the incompressible Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations. The order of accuracy and stability characteristics of the present method are analyzed in simulations of an unsteady convection{\textendash}diffusion problem, decaying vortices, flow in a lid-driven cavity, flow over a circular cylinder, and turbulent flow through a planar channel. Numerical solutions predicted by the proposed ADI finite-volume method are found to be in good agreement with experimental and other numerical data, while the solutions are obtained at much lower computational cost than those required by other iterative methods without factorization. For a simulation on a grid with O(105) cells, the computational time required by the present ADI-based method for a solution of momentum equations is found to be less than 20\% of that required by a method employing a biconjugate-gradient-stabilized scheme.},

	abstract = {Some recent studies on the effects of truncation and aliasing errors on the large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flows via the concept of modified wave number are revisited. It is shown that all the results obtained for nonlinear partial differential equations projected and advanced in time in spectral space are not straightforwardly applicable to physical space calculations due to the nonequivalence by Fourier transform of spectral aliasing errors and numerical errors on a set of grid points in physical space. The consequences of spectral static aliasing errors on a set of grid points are analyzed in one dimension of space for quadratic products and their derivatives. The dynamical process that results through time stepping is illustrated on the Burgers equation. A method based on midpoint interpolation is proposed to remove in physical space the static grid point errors involved in divergence forms. It is compared to the sharp filtering technique on finer grids suggested by previous authors. Global performances resulting from combination of static aliasing errors and truncation errors are then discussed for all classical forms of the convective terms in Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations. Some analytical results previously obtained on the relative magnitude of subgrid scale terms and numerical errors are confirmed with 3D realistic random fields. The physical space dynamical behavior and the stability of typical associations of numerical schemes and forms of nonlinear terms are finally evaluated on the LES of self-decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. It is shown that the convective form (if conservative properties are not strictly required) associated with highly resolving compact finite difference schemes provides the best compromise, which is nearly equivalent to dealiased pseudo-spectral calculations.},

The scheme is based on the vorticity-stream function formulation. It is essentially compact and has the nice features of a compact scheme with regard to the treatment of boundary conditions. It is also very efficient, at every time step or Runge{\textendash}Kutta stage, only two Poisson-like equations have to be solved. The Poisson-like equations are amenable to standard fast Poisson solvers usually designed for second order schemes. Detailed comparison with the second-order scheme shows the clear superiority of this new fourth-order scheme in resolving both the boundary layers and the gross features of the flow. This efficient fourth-order scheme also made it possible to compute the driven cavity flow at Reynolds number 106on a 10242grid at a reasonable cost. Fourth-order convergence is proved under mild regularity requirements. This is the first such result to our knowledge.},

The high-order compact schemes on non-uniform grids developed in Shukla and Zhong [R.K. Shukla, X. Zhong, Derivation of high-order compact finite difference schemes for non-uniform grid using polynomial interpolation, J. Comput. Phys. 204 (2005) 404] for linear model equations are extended to the full Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations in the vorticity and streamfunction formulation. Two methods for the solution of Helmholtz and Poisson equations using high-order compact schemes on non-uniform grids are developed. The schemes are constructed so that they maintain a high-order of accuracy not only in the interior but also at the boundary. Second-order semi-implicit temporal discretization is achieved through an implicit Backward Differentiation scheme for the linear viscous terms and an explicit Adam{\textendash}Bashforth scheme for the non-linear convective terms. The boundary values of vorticity are determined using an influence matrix technique. The resulting discretized system with boundary closures of the same high-order as the interior is shown to be stable, when applied to the two-dimensional incompressible Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations, provided enough grid points are clustered at the boundary. The resolution characteristics of the high-order compact finite difference schemes are illustrated through their application to the one-dimensional linear wave equation and the two-dimensional driven cavity flow. Comparisons with the benchmark solutions for the two-dimensional driven cavity flow, thermal convection in a square box and flow past an impulsively started cylinder show that the high-order compact schemes are stable and produce extremely accurate results on a stretched grid with more points clustered at the boundary.},

	abstract = {This work conducts the analysis of fuel elements of gas-cooled and graphite-moderated
reactors containing TRISO particles, studying the main characteristics following a
neutron-oriented approach to conceptual design stage. The study of the special char-
acteristics of these fuels requires the development and implementation of calculation
chains to achieve a true representation of the different degrees of heterogeneity present,
as well as computation time that allows a sensitivity study of the main design param-
eters.
    Therefore, the development of this work includes a two-dimensional equivalent
model that allows an adequate representation of TRISO particles and spherical fuel
elements using the CONDOR and WIMSD codes. The comparison of cell calculation
results with those obtained by using the Monte Carlo code SERPENT show acceptable
differences between them, allowing the use of the equivalent model in early stages of
design. It has been found that the equivalent model can be used directly with CON-
DOR, while for use with WIMSD external Dancoff factor calculations are necessary.
The validation process is completed with criticality calculation of the HTR-PROTEUS
reactor and comparison with experimental results, showing that with this fuel model
the differences between measured and calculated values are of the same order as those
reported by several groups in the literature.
    After the model validation is performed, an analysis of the neutronic behavior of
fuel elements with TRISO particles is carried out, studying the effects of changes in key
design parameters such as enrichment, size and number of TRISO particles, and size
area in which are located within a fuel. The coupling of a levelized cycle cost model
allows the search of design configurations that improve profitability and maximize the
potential use of such fuels.},

	abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods employ two types of grid: structured and unstructured. Developing the solver and data structures for a finite-volume solver is easier than for unstructured grids. But real-life problems are too complicated to be fitted flexibly by structured grids. Therefore, unstructured grids are widely used for solving real-life problems. However, using only one type of unstructured element consumes a lot of computational time because the number of elements cannot be controlled. Hence, a hybrid grid that contains mixed elements, such as the use of hexahedral elements along with tetrahedral and pyramidal elements, gives the user control over the number of elements in the domain, and thus only the domain that requires a finer grid is meshed finer and not the entire domain. This work aims to develop such a finite-volume hybrid grid solver capable of handling turbulence flows and conjugate heat transfer. It has been extended to solving flow involving separation and subsequent reattachment occurring due to sudden expansion or contraction. A significant effect of mixing high- and low-enthalpy fluid occurs in the reattached regions of these devices. This makes the study of the backward-facing and forward-facing step with heat transfer an important field of research. The problem of the forward-facing step with conjugate heat transfer was taken up and solved for turbulence flow using a two-equation model of k-$\omega$. The variation in the flow profile and heat transfer behavior has been studied with the variation in Re and solid to fluid thermal conductivity ratios. The results for the variation in local Nusselt number, interface temperature and skin friction factor are presented.},

	abstract = {An experimental study of low level turbulence natural convection in an air filled vertical square cavity was conducted. The dimensions of cavity were 0.75 m {\texttimes} 0.75 m {\texttimes} 1.5 m giving two-dimensional flow. The hot and cold walls of the cavity were isothermal at 50 and 10{\textdegree}C, respectively, giving a Rayleigh number of 1.58 {\texttimes} 109. The temperature and velocity distribution was systematically measured at different locations in the cavity, and was nearly anti-symmetrical. An experimentally obtained contour plot of the thermal field and a vector plot of the air flow in the cavity are reported for low turbulence natural convection in such cavities for the first time. The wall shear stress and the local and average Nusselt numbers are also presented. The Nusselt number compares well with previous results; the agreement on the velocity and temperature profiles at mid-height near the vertical walls is fair. Differences were found at mid-width and in the rate of velocity and temperature changes near the walls. The experiments were conducted with high accuracy. Therefore, the results can form experimental benchmark data and will be useful for CFD code validation.},

	abstract = {Proper boundary condition implementation can be critical for efficient, accurate numerical simulations when a pressure-based finite volume methodology is used to solve fluid flow and heat transfer problems, especially when an unstructured mesh is used for domain discretization. This paper systematically addresses the relationships between the flow boundary conditions for the discretized momentum equations and the corresponding conditions for the (Poisson type) pressure-linked equation in the context of a cell-centred finite volume formulation employing unstructured grids and a collocated variable arrangement. Special attention is paid to the treatment of the outflow boundary where flow conditions are either known to be fully developed (if a long enough channel is used) or unknown prior to solution (if a truncated channel is used). In the latter case, due to the singularity of the coefficient matrix of the pressure-linked equation, no pressure or pressure corrector solution can exist without explicitly enforcing global mass conservation (GMC) during each iteration. After evaluating published methods designed to ensure GMC, two new methods are proposed to correct for global mass imbalance. The validity of the overall methodology is demonstrated by solving the evolving flow between two parallel plates and the laminar flow over a backward-facing step on progressively truncated domains. In the latter case, our methodology is shown to handle situations where the outflow boundary passes through a recirculation zone.},

In the current analysis, a linear advection{\textendash}diffusion equation in a Cartesian coordinate system is transformed into a curvilinear one corresponding to a skewed mesh. A finite-difference approximation of the transformed equation leads to the leading-order error terms which are responsible for time-step restrictions and numerical instability. A truncation error analysis of central-difference approximation reveals the effects of mesh non-uniformity and skewness on the solution quality. In addition, a modified wavenumber analysis is performed for the central- and upwind-difference schemes coupled with time-integration methods, to examine the effects of mesh skewness angle and flow direction relative to the mesh angle on the numerical stability. In general, severe mesh skewness leads to restrictions on the allowable cell Peclet number and time-step size and also increases phase and amplitude errors.},

	abstract = {A non-iterative method for handling the coupling of the implicitly discretised time-dependent fluid flow equations is described. The method is based on the use of pressure and velocity as dependent variables and is hence applicable to both the compressible and incompressible versions of the transport equations. The main feature of the technique is the splitting of the solution process into a series of steps whereby operations on pressure are decoupled from those on velocity at each step, with the split sets of equations being amenable to solution by standard techniques. At each time-step, the procedure yields solutions which approximate the exact solution of the difference equations. The accuracy of this splitting procedure is assessed for a linearised form of the discretised equations, and the analysis indicates that the solution yielded by it differs from the exact solution of the difference equations by terms proportional to the powers of the time-step size. By virtue of this, it is possible to dispense with iteration, thus resulting in an efficient implicit scheme while retaining simplicity of implementation relative to contemporary block simultaneous methods. This is verified in a companion paper which presents results of computations carried out using the method.},

The results of calculations are compared with similar ones obtained with an existing iterative method. It is shown that for time-evolving flows the splitting error of PISO is negligibly small at the level of time-step required to eliminate the temporal truncation error, while the avoidance of iteration results in a substantial reduction in computing effort over that required by iterative methods. It is also demonstrated that PISO is stable for fairly large time steps, which renders it useful for steady-state calculations as well.},

Careful testing performed for the wall-driven square enclosure flow configuration shows that the consistently derived version of QUICK is more stable and converges faster than any of the formulations previously employed.

The operators of this class are designed for variational multiscale large eddy simulation using a finite volume or finite element method. Two representatives are compared to discrete smooth filters, which are widely used in the traditional large eddy simulation literature; the comparison shows that they are not only theoretically different, but also yield considerable differences in the respective numerical results. Dynamic as well as constant-coefficient-based subgrid-scale modeling is used within the multiscale environment. All of the scale-separating operators are implemented in a second-order accurate energy-conserving finite volume method and tested for the case of a turbulent channel flow. One operator shows particularly remarkable results in the framework of the variational multiscale large eddy simulation, that is, profiles are obtained for velocity and kinetic energy which are considerably closer to the respective profiles from a direct numerical simulation than are the profiles resulting from the application of the other operators considered in the present study. Furthermore, this particular operator proves to be very efficient with regard to the important aspect of computational cost, that is, a reduction in computing time ranging from about 25\% up to about 150\% compared to the other operators. The introduction of a substantial amount of subgrid viscosity to the small scales, particularly in the buffer layer of the channel, appears to be crucial for the good results achieved with this method.},

Simply stated, the method consists of applying an existing dynamic trajectory optimization algorithm to successive spherical quadratic approximations of the actual optimization problem. The Dynamic-Q algorithm has the advantage of having minimal storage requirements, thus making it suitable for problems with large numbers of variables. The Dynamic-Q method is tested and results obtained are compared to results for a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. Indications are that the new method is robust and efficient, and particularly well suited to practical engineering optimization problems.},

	abstract = {Methods for the quantification of numerical
uncertainty have been a subject of interest to
ASME and the mechanical engineering community
as a whole for over a decade. During this time
period, ASME has promulgated two statements of
standards for the reporting of numerical uncertainty
in archival publications. This paper reviews the
work that has gone into the specification of these
standards, and the formulation of methods for
quantifying numerical uncertainty. The objective
of this paper is not to define a strategy for
verification and validation as procedures, but rather
to focus on the estimation of the magnitude of
numerical uncertainty in a given simulation.
Further, this paper makes no judgment on what is
an acceptable level of uncertainty in a simulation.
The premise behind this paper is simply the
realization that methods for predicting the
magnitude of uncertainty or for banding the
magnitude of the error are required for any
verification and validation procedure. Clearly, any
of a number of possible methods may be used to
calculate numerical uncertainty. The present paper
presents one possible approach. This approach is a
five-step procedure for the estimation of numerical
uncertainty based on Richardson Extrapolation and
measured by the Grid Convergence Index.},

Then, the authors undertake an analysis of magnetically confined, inertially confined, and low-temperature fusion energy concepts. Subsequently, they introduce the important blanket domains surrounding the fusion core and discuss synergetic fusion - fission systems. Finally, they consider selected conceptual and technological subjects germane to the continuing development of fusion energy systems."--Jacket.},

	abstract = {Heat transfer is the area of engineering science which describes the energy transport between material bodies due to a difference in temperature. The three different modes of heat transport are conduction, convection and radiation. In most problems, these three modes exist simultaneously. However, the significance of these modes depends on the problems studied and often, insignificant modes are neglected. Very often books published on Computational Fluid Dynamics using the Finite Element Method give very little or no significance to thermal or heat transfer problems. From the research point of view, it is important to explain the handling of various types of heat transfer problems with different types of complex boundary conditions. Problems with slow fluid motion and heat transfer can be difficult problems to handle. Therefore, the complexity of combined fluid flow and heat transfer problems should not be underestimated and should be dealt with carefully. This book: Is ideal for teaching senior undergraduates the fundamentals of how to use the Finite Element Method to solve heat transfer and fluid dynamics problems. Explains how to solve various heat transfer problems with different types of boundary conditions. Uses recent computational methods and codes to handle complex fluid motion and heat transfer problems. Includes a large number of examples and exercises on heat transfer problems. In an era of parallel computing, computational efficiency and easy to handle codes play a major part. Bearing all these points in mind, the topics covered on combined flow and heat transfer in this book will be an asset for practising engineers and postgraduate students. Other topics of interest for the heat transfer community, such as heat exchangers and radiation heat transfer, are also included.},

The most up-to date and comprehensive book in the field, Fundamentals of Creep in Metals and Alloys discusses the fundamentals of time-dependent plasticity or creep plasticity in metals, alloys and metallic compounds. This is the first book of its kind that provides broad coverage of a range of materials not just a sub-group such as metallic compounds, superalloys or crystals. As such it presents the most balanced view of creep for all materials scientists. The theory of all of these phenomena are extensively reviewed and analysed in view of an extensive bibliography that includes the most recent publications in the field. All sections of the book have undergone extensive peer review and therefore the reader can be sure they have access to the most up-to-date research, fully interrogated, from the worlds leading investigators.

Today, scientific computing is playing an ever more prominent role as a tool in scientific discovery and engineering analysis. In this second edition, the key addition is an introduction to the finite element method. This is a widely used technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in complex domains. This text introduces numerical methods and shows how to develop, analyze, and use them. Complete MATLAB programs for all the worked examples are now available at www.cambridge.org/Moin, and more than 30 exercises have been added. This thorough and practical book is intended as a first course in numerical analysis, primarily for new graduate students in engineering and physical science. Along with mastering the fundamentals of numerical methods, students will learn to write their own computer programs using standard numerical methods"--Provided by publisher.},

	abstract = {The natural convection heat losses occurring from cubical open cavities are analysed in this paper. Open cubical cavities of sides 0.1\&\#x2009;m, 0.2\&\#x2009;m, 0.25\&\#x2009;m, 0.5\&\#x2009;m, and 1\&\#x2009;m with constant temperature back wall boundary conditions and opening ratio of 1 are studied. The Fluent CFD software is used to analyse the three-dimensional (3D) cavity models. The studies are carried out for cavities with back wall temperatures between 35\&\#xb0;C and 100\&\#xb0;C. The effect of cavity inclination on the convective loss is analysed for angles of 0\&\#xb0; (cavity facing sideways), 30\&\#xb0;, 45\&\#xb0;, 60\&\#xb0;, and 90\&\#xb0; (cavity facing vertically downwards). The Rayleigh numbers involved in this study range between 4.5 \&\#xd7; 105 and 1.5 \&\#xd7; 109. The natural convection loss is found to increase with an increase in back wall temperature. The natural convection loss is observed to decrease with an increase in cavity inclination; the highest convective loss being at 0\&\#xb0; and the lowest at 90\&\#xb0; inclination. This is observed for all cavities analysed here. Nusselt number correlations involving the effect of Rayleigh number and the cavity inclination angle have been developed from the current studies. These correlations can be used for engineering applications such as electronic cooling, low- and medium-temperature solar thermal systems, passive architecture, and also refrigeration systems.},

	abstract = {Industrial growth, energy consumption are seen as measures towards economic developments. With increase in industrial development worldwide, the demand of energy is continually on the rise. Today, the energy industry is facing many challenges. Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are seen as important future energy sources. Development of innovative reactor designs with large efficiency for fuel burn up is one of the needs of fission reactors. The materials resistant to high dose of radiations in fusion reactors is another major challenge. The production of electricity without global warming is an important pressing demand on the energy sector. The demands on quality control of components for nuclear and heavy industry are very stringent. Development of well characterized, high quality materials is therefore essential for safe, efficient and reliable operation of engineering components. The diagnosis of failure of machinery parts comes from the post operational characterization of materials. Various destructive and non-destructive techniques are used for this purpose. Research reactors have played an important role in non-destructive characterization of materials and have contributed to technology development. This publication focuses on characterization of materials for industries in general and nuclear energy sector in particular. The main focus is on research reactor based techniques with some discussion on other allied methods like positron annihilation.--Publisher's description.},

	isbn = {978-0-85709-534-3},
	abstract = {Corrosion of nuclear materials, i.e. the interaction between these materials and their environments, is a major issue for plant safety as well as for operation and economic competitiveness. Understanding these corrosion mechanisms, the systems and materials they affect, and the methods to accurately measure their incidence is of critical importance to the nuclear industry. Combining assessment techniques and analytical models into this understanding allows operators to predict the service life of corrosion-affected nuclear plant materials, and to apply the most appropriate maintenance and mitigation options to ensure safe long term operation.This book critically reviews the fundamental corrosion mechanisms that affect nuclear power plants and facilities. Initial sections introduce the complex field of nuclear corrosion science, with detailed chapters on the different types of both aqueous and non aqueous corrosion mechanisms and the nuclear materials susceptible to attack from them. This is complemented by reviews of monitoring and control methodologies, as well as modelling and lifetime prediction approaches. Given that corrosion is an applied science, the final sections review corrosion issues across the range of current and next-generation nuclear reactors, and across such nuclear applications as fuel reprocessing facilities, radioactive waste storage and geological disposal systems.With its distinguished editor and international team of expert contributors, Nuclear corrosion science and engineering is an invaluable reference for nuclear metallurgists, materials scientists and engineers, as well as nuclear facility operators, regulators and consultants, and researchers and academics in this field.Comprehensively reviews the fundamental corrosion mechanisms that affect nuclear power plants and facilitiesChapters assess different types of both aqueous and non aqueous corrosion mechanisms and the nuclear materials susceptible to attack from themConsiders monitoring and control methodologies, as well as modelling and lifetime prediction approaches},

	abstract = {A new physics analysis procedure has been developed for a prismatic very high temperature gas-cooled reactor based on a conventional two-step procedure for the PWR physics analysis. The HELIOS and MASTER codes were employed to generate the coarse group cross sections through a transport lattice calculation, and to perform the 3-dimensional core physics analysis by a nodal diffusion calculation, respectively. Physics analysis of the prismatic VHTRs involves particular modeling issues such as a double heterogeneity of the coated fuel particles, a neutron streaming in the coolant channels, a strong core-reflector interaction, and large spectrum shifts due to changes of the surrounding environment and state parameters. Double heterogeneity effect was considered by using a recently developed reactivity-equivalent physical transformation method. Neutron streaming effect was quantified through 3-dimensional Monte Carlo transport calculations by using the MCNP code. Strong core-reflector interaction could be handled by applying an equivalence theory to the generation of the reflector cross sections. The effects of a spectrum shift could be covered by optimizing the coarse energy group structure. A two-step analysis procedure was established for the prismatic VHTR physics analysis by combining all the methodologies described above. The applicability of our code system was tested against core benchmark problems. The results of these benchmark tests show that our code system is very accurate and practical for a prismatic VHTR physics analysis.},

	abstract = {The generation of accurate few-group nodal parameters, which strongly influences the accuracy of a reactor core criticality analysis, constitutes an important aspect of the work in developing advanced neutronics methodologies for pebble bed reactors (PBRs). As compared to other methodologies currently used for light water reactors (LWRs), the calculation at the core sub-region level for PBRs needs to account for the third spatial dimension because of the double heterogeneity of the configuration. This paper considers two modeling approaches for few-group cross-section generation: Monte Carlo (the MCNP code) and deterministic transport (the MICROX-2 code). Results from these codes are used to discuss the effect of the modeling assumptions (parameters) on the accuracy of the solution. Few-group cross-sections and spectral indices are calculated and compared for different packing fractions of the pebbles in the pebble lattice cell and different values of the moderator-to-fuel pebble ratio, temperature, and fuel burnup.},

	abstract = {A method is presented for the evaluation of microscopic cross sections for the Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) neutron diffusion computational models during convergence to an equilibrium (asymptotic) fuel cycle. This method considers the isotopics within a core spectral zone and the leakages from such a zone as they arise during reactor operation. The randomness of the spatial distribution of fuel grains within the fuel pebbles and that of the fuel and moderator pebbles within the core, the double heterogeneity of the fuel, and the indeterminate burnup of the spectral zones all pose a unique challenge for the computation of the local microscopic cross sections. As prior knowledge of the equilibrium composition and leakage is not available, it is necessary to repeatedly re-compute the group constants with updated zone information. A method is presented to account for local spectral zone composition and leakage effects without resorting to frequent spectrum code calls. Fine group data are pre-computed for a range of isotopic states. Microscopic cross sections and zone nuclide number densities are used to construct fine group macroscopic cross sections, which, together with fission spectra, flux modulation factors, and zone buckling, are used in the solution of the slowing down balance to generate a new or updated spectrum. The microscopic cross-sections are then re-collapsed with the new spectrum for the local spectral zone. This technique is named the Spectral History Correction (SHC) method. It is found that this method accurately recalculates local broad group microscopic cross sections. Significant improvement in the core eigenvalue, flux, and power peaking factor is observed when the local cross sections are corrected for the effects of the spectral zone composition and leakage in two-dimensional PBR test problems.},

	abstract = {In pebble bed reactors the pebbles have a random distribution within the core. The usual approach in modeling the bed is homogenizing the entire bed. To quantify the errors arising in such a model, this article investigates the effect on keff of three phenomena in random pebble distributions: non-uniform packing density, neutron streaming in between the pebbles, and variations in Dancoff factor. For a 100 cm high cylinder with reflective top and bottom boundary conditions 25 pebble beds were generated. Of each bed three core models were made: a homogeneous model, a zones model including density fluctuations, and an exact model with all pebbles modeled individually. The same was done for a model of the PROTEUS facility. keff calculations were performed with three codes: Monte Carlo, diffusion, and finite element transport. By comparing keff of the homogenized and zones model the effect of including density fluctuations in the pebble bed was found to increase keff by 71 pcm for the infinite cylinder and 649 pcm for PROTEUS. The large value for PROTEUS is due to the low packing fraction near the top of the pebble bed, causing a significant lower packing fraction for the bulk of the pebble bed in the homogenized model. The effect of neutron streaming was calculated by comparing the zones model with the exact model, and was found to decrease keff by 606 pcm for the infinite cylinder, and by 1240 pcm for PROTEUS. This was compared with the effect of using a streaming correction factor on the diffusion coefficient in the zones model, which resulted in $\Delta$streaming values of 340 and 1085 pcm. From this we conclude neutron streaming is an important effect in pebble bed reactors, and is not accurately described by the correction factor on the diffusion coefficient. Changing the Dancoff factor in the outer part of the pebble bed to compensate for the lower probability of neutrons to enter other fuel pebbles caused no significant changes in keff, showing that variations in Dancoff factor in pebble bed reactors can be ignored.},

This multiscale method aims at stable and accurate solutions of transient convection{\textendash}diffusion-reaction problems. The method is constituted by a time-discontinuous space{\textendash}time finite element method on the fine-scale level, an explicit procedure for advancing the coarse-scale solution on the respective level, and inter-scale operators providing the data transfer between the coarse- and fine-scale level in both directions. The results from three numerical test cases show that for both problematic flow regimes, that is, the regime of dominant convection and the regime of dominant convection and absorption, the proposed method provides completely stable solutions, which are not achieved by standard stabilized methods, particularly for the later regime. For remedying a still to be noted shortcoming of the proposed method, that is, a too smooth resolution of sharp-gradient regions in the solution field, considerable improvement can be provided by the use of cubic spline interpolation as the spatial reconstruction (i.e., the spatial coarse-to-fine inter-scale) operator.},

Conservation equations are solved by finite difference{\textendash}control volume numerical method. The relevant governing parameters are: the Rayleigh numbers from 109 to 1012, the Prandtl number, Pr = 0.7, constant for air, the cavity aspect ratio, A = L/H from 0.4 to 1, the wall thickness l/H = 0.02{\textendash}0.08, the conductivity ratio kr from 1 to 50 and the surface emissivity, $\varepsilon$ from 0 to 1. We found that the surface radiation affected the flow and temperature fields considerably. The influence of the surface radiation is to decrease the heat fluxes by natural convection and conduction while the heat flux by radiation increases with increasing surface emissivity. On the other hand, the convective and radiative Nusselt numbers are increasing functions of the surface emissivity for a given wall conductance. The combined Nusselt number and the volume flow rate are both increasing functions of the surface emissivity, particularly at high Rayleigh numbers. The convective and radiative Nusselt numbers are a decreasing function of the wall conductance and an increasing function of the aspect ratio. We found similar trends for the volume flow rate through the cavity.},

However, current understanding of factors that influence this process is still incomplete. In this paper, a model is developed to describe the effect of contact angle on the bubble departure from an upward-facing horizontal surface. Based on the concept of macro- and micro-contact angles, this model gives an explicit theoretical relation between the bubble departure diameter and the contact angle. Agreement with previous experimental data confirms the predictive ability of the present model.},

	abstract = {Using the Ghost Fluid Method for sharp interface representation, bubble dynamics and heat transfer during single bubble pool boiling of saturated FC-72 are simulated numerically with transient thermal response of the heated SiO2 solid wall. A constant and uniform temperature is fixed on to the bottom surface of the solid wall in the simulations, and thus, both the spatio-temporal averaged heat flux and superheat on the top surface, which contacts the working fluid directly, are dependent variables instead of controllable ones. Multi-cycle simulations are carried out to eliminate the influence of unreal initial conditions. Steady periodical processes of single bubble pool boiling can be reached on the wall with a thickness of 1 mm, while only quasi-steady ones on the wall with a thickness of 5 mm due to the limited simulation time, which results in a smaller thermal penetration depth inside the solid wall compared with its thickness. Comparing with the prediction of the correlation by Zuber for the discrete bubble region and experimental data of single bubble pool boiling, the numerical results of boiling curves in both steady and quasi-steady cases exhibit the same trend. Transient heat conduction inside the solid wall is analyzed in detail. A sharp drop of the wall temperature is evident in the vicinity of the contact line due to violent evaporation in this tiny region. The area of the temperature drop moves with the contact line, resulting in a pseudo-periodical process of heat storage and release inside the solid wall, which exhibits a coupling effect with bubble dynamics and heat transfer. The thermal penetration depth caused by the processes of bubble growth and departure in a single bubble cycle is about 0.5 mm in both steady and quasi-steady cases, which is much small than the heater thickness.},

In the numerical method, the dynamical interface is captured by the three-dimensional coupled volume of fluid and level set (VOSET) method. The Navier-Stokes equations for the incompressible two-phase flows with surface tension and gravity, along with the continuity and energy equations are solved using the 3D-IDEAL algorithm. The three dimensional solid wall is also coupled into the solver to study the response of a heated solid surface during nucleate boiling. An experiment with working fluid FC-72 was set up to investigate the bubble behavior and heat transfer during the nucleate boiling process. Good agreement is observed between the simulation results and experimental data in prediction of bubble shape during the growth time. It is also found that the departure diameter of saturated FC-72 predicted by the proposed method matches very well with Phan{\textquoteright}s correlation.

The detailed ebullition process at pore scale level is revealed, and the effects of wettability, porosity and porous structures on bubble behaviors and heat transfer are further analyzed. We found that bubble coalescence helps bubbles to be squeezed out of pores and bubbles accumulate more closely at the solid surface with increasing static contact angle. A thin liquid film forms between the bubble and solid surface with the static contact angle of 46.2{\textdegree}. Bubbles at the bottom of the porous metals are hard to escape, and bubbles coalesce frequently at the bottom of porous metals with lower porosity. Bubbles escape more easily in gradient porous metals than uniform porous metals in flow boiling simulation.},

With respect to boiling flow in a single microchannel, the bubble nucleation, growth, and departure are simulated by using an improved hybrid LB model. Relating bubble behavior with fluid flow and boiling heat transfer provides some insight into the relevant fundamental physics on flow boiling in the microchannel. It is found that the bubble growth before its departure from the wall induces an obvious resistance to the fluid flow. The processes of nucleation and motion of different bubbles interact, leading to an alternate, either enhanced or weakened, effect of bubble behavior on the flow boiling.},

	abstract = {Compared to the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equation-based approach, the method of lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) offers an alternative treatment for fluid dynamics. The LBE method often employs uniform lattices to maintain a compact and efficient computational procedure, which makes it less efficient to perform flow simulations when there is a need for high resolution near the body and/or there is a far-field boundary. To resolve these difficulties, a multi-block method is developed. An accurate, conservative interface treatment between neighboring blocks is adopted, and demonstrated that it satisfies the continuity of mass, momentum, and stresses across the interface. Several test cases are employed to assess accuracy improvement with respect to grid refinement, the impact of the corner singularity, and the Reynolds number scaling. The present multi-block method can substantially improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of the LBE method for viscous flow computations.

A new scheme for the force term is proposed and simulation results of several non-ideal equation of state suggest that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the coexistence curves. Among several methods of incorporating the force term, the exact difference method is shown to have better accuracy and stability. Furthermore, it avoids the unphysical phenomenon of relaxation time dependence. Compared with existing models, the proposed model, consisting of the new force term scheme together with the exact different method to incorporate the force term, can give more accurate and stable numerical results in a wider temperature range with the spurious currents greatly reduced. Droplet motion and coalescence processes on surfaces with wettability gradients are numerically investigated based on the newly proposed model.

The possibility of specifying the exact position of the boundary, independently of other simulation parameters, simplifies the analysis of the system. For practical applications it should allow one to freely specify the direction of the flux, and it should be straightforward to implement in three dimensions. Furthermore, especially for parallelized solvers, it is of great advantage if the boundary condition can be applied locally, involving only information available on the current lattice site. We meet this need by describing in detail how to transfer the approach suggested by Zou and He to a D3Q19 lattice. The boundary condition acts locally, is independent of the details of the relaxation process during collision and contains no artificial slip. In particular, the case of an on-site no-slip boundary condition is naturally included. We test the boundary condition in several setups and confirm that it can be used to accurately model the velocity field up to second order and does not contain any numerical slip.},

An analytical expression for CHF of a heated surface with micro/nano-size structures is obtained in terms of the surface roughness factor, the solid fraction as well as the contact angle explicitly. It is shown that geometric parameters of these micro/nano structures influence the ability of liquid spreading on a hydrophilic surface, effectively supplying liquid to the heated surface, and thus delaying the occurrence of the CHF. The micro/nanosized cavities provide additional sites for vapor formation, altering the critical distance between vapor columns and thus reducing the critical instability wavelength. The critical wavelength for the occurrence of critical heat flux is obtained based on the change in surface free energy. The predicted values of CHF on heated surfaces with micro/nano-size structures in pool boiling obtained from the present model are found in agreement with existing experimental data.},

Various enhancement surfaces were attached to an electrically heated copper calorimeter bar having a vertically oriented heat transfer surface area of 12.7{\texttimes}12.7 mm2. A number of enhancement schemes aimed at a reduction of the incipience temperature overshoot were tested, employing various arrangements of fins, studs, grooves, and vapor-trapping cavities. Atmospheric pressure testing revealed a variation in the magnitude of boiling curve incipience temperature excursion as a function of both macro- and microcharacterization of the surface geometry and initial conditions (pressure and temperature history) prior to boiling. Increased incipience temperatures accompanied prolonged periods of nonboiling. It is assumed that this is due to vapor embryos within surface cavities collapsing to smaller radii. Large artificially created cavities (0.3 mm diameter) were found incapable of maintaining a stable vapor embryo for time periods greater than 10 min. In comparison to flat surfaces, low-profile surface geometries having a structure scale of the order of one bubble departure diameter resulted in significant enhancement of nucleate boiling while drilled surfaces had minimal effectiveness. Surface finish and artificial cavities had no effect on CHF, but levels of critical heat flux computed on base area were strongly dependent on macrogeometry, due in part to increased surface area.},

The term {\textquotedblleft}double enhancement{\textquotedblright} refers to the combination of two different enhancement techniques: a large-scale area enhancement (square pin fin array) and a small-scale surface enhancement (microporous coating). Fin lengths were varied from 0 (flat surface) to 8 mm. Effects of this double enhancement technique on critical heat flux (CHF) and nucleate boiling heat transfer in the horizontal orientation (fins are vertical) are investigated. Results showed significant increases in nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficients with the application of the microporous coating to the heater surfaces. CHF was found to be relatively insensitive to surface microstructure for the finned surfaces except in the case of the surface with 8-mm-long fins. The nucleate boiling and CHF behavior has been found to be the result of multiple, counteracting mechanisms: surface area enhancement, fin efficiency, surface microstructure (active nucleation site density), vapor bubble departure resistance, and re-wetting liquid flow resistance.

They include macroscale, microscale, and nanoscale surfaces, as well as multiscale (hybrid-scale), and hybrid-wettability techniques. Different enhancement methods are assessed in terms of underlying fluid routing mechanisms and ability to achieve three distinct heat transfer goals: eliminating incipient boiling hysteresis, increasing nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient, and ameliorating critical heat flux (CHF), especially for inert dielectric coolants that are both highly wetting and possess relatively poor thermophysical properties. While different enhancement scales are shown to provide different degrees of success in achieving the three goals, it is shown that both microscale and nanoscale surface features are susceptible to blockage, resulting in deterioration of the enhancement over time. This review also points to scarcity of sufficiently sized databases for a given enhancement scheme in terms of fluid type, surface material, size, and orientation, enhancement shape, pattern, and scale, and operating pressure. This renders available findings less-than-adequate tools for design of practical cooling systems.},

In this paper, we conducted a numerical study by lattice Boltzmann method on the nucleation site interactions during pool boiling. The LBM is featured of a multiple-relaxationtime algorithm with hybrid thermal scheme which can carefully control the parameters that influence boiling and keep other factors unchanged. The numerical results show that temperature at the given nucleation sites has strong dependence at short separation distance, and consequently the wall superheat could change the thermal and hydrodynamic interactions between nucleation sites. Moreover, wettability also plays a critical role in boiling, so the effects of wettability on nucleation site interactions were also studied, results show that nucleation site interactions on hydrophobic surface are mainly promotive, which is different from hydrophilic surface. These findings can be used to better understand the mechanism of nucleation site interactions and explain the divergence of previous experimental results.},

Femtosecond laser processing was used to fabricate the structured surfaces. It was found that for the surfaces with small processing spacing (LS30 and LS70, where the number after LS specifies the spacing in lm), the critical heat flux (CHF) showed almost no increase, while the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) was enhanced noticeably compared to that of a smooth surface (SS). For LS100, LS200, LS200-2 (compared to LS200, LS200-2 has the same processing spacing but a much higher peak-to-valley height), LS400 and LS800, both the CHF and HTC were enhanced remarkably compared to those of SS. The maximum HTC enhancement was obtained for LS70, with the HTC being 5.87 times larger than that of SS. The most remarkable increase in the CHF was achieved for LS200-2, with an improvement of 91\% relative to that of SS. The liquid supply mechanism at the CHF of the micro/nano hierarchically structured surfaces was investigated. A modified model taking into account the coalesced bubble departure frequency, Jakob number and capillary wicking effects was proposed for CHF prediction. The CHF data from this study and the literature were used to validate the model, and it was found that the predicted results agree quite well with the experimental data within {\textpm}8\%.},

	abstract = {Pool boiling heat transfer enhancement on structured surfaces with columns is investigated by a thermal two-phase lattice Boltzmann model. The effects of geometrical parameters, including column height (H), width (W) and gap spacing (D), are discussed in detail. The size of columns is comparable to the diameter of a typical detached bubble (db). It is found that the heat transfer performance mainly depends on two factors: the heated surface area A and local convective flow field. When W and D are properly chosen as about W {\textonequarter} D \% 4db, increasing H enhances the heat transfer solely due to the increase of the surface area. When W and D are small, it is observed that the top of the columns and the channels are mostly covered by a layer of vapor, respectively, which weaken the convection. Under the circumstances, although surface area A increases, heat transfer enhancement is not so significant. For the surface tension effect, the enhancement of the structured surface decreases with the increase of capillary number compared to that of the plain surface. The mechanism is that at larger capillary number, the convection close to the channel may be partially blocked, which hinders the heat transfer. An optimal enhancement could be achieved when A is as large as possible and meanwhile the convection is not hindered by the bubbles behaviors. The finding here may shed some light on mechanism of heat transfer enhancement on structured surfaces with columns.},

With an innovative nucleation site treatment on the wall, the complete boiling stages as well as the boiling curve were successfully reproduced without adding any heating fluctuations. The bubble nucleation, growth, departure, and coalescence are well captured. Some basic features of boiling heat transfer including bubble nucleation site activation, bubble departure frequency, character of bubble shape at different regime, and horizontal movement of bubble during the boiling process were clearly observed in the numerical results.},

	abstract = {Understanding heat transfer process of liquid thin film evaporation in porous media or on microstructured surfaces is the key for optimal designs of phase-change based thermal management devices, such as vapor chambers or flat heat pipes. In this paper, a newly developed 3D thermal Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), incorporating double distribution functions (DDF), pseudo-potential model and equation of state (EOS) of a real gas, is used to simulate dynamic evaporation along the vapor/liquid interface and boiling in the liquid thin film on a microstructured surface consisting of micro pillars. Simulations are conducted under constant heat fluxes for four solid hydrophilic surfaces with contact angles of 10{\textdegree}, 23{\textdegree}, 37{\textdegree} and 63{\textdegree} respectively. Residual liquid volume, two-phase interface morphology, wall temperature distribution, as well as effective heat transfer coefficient and CHF under different conditions are discussed in details. With increasing heat flux, it is found that the liquid thin film recedes gradually into the wick structure, with the lowest liquid level at the center of the heating area, to maintain a continuous liquid supply via capillary pumping. The receding of the liquid thin film can normally enhance evaporation heat transfer because it not only reduces the thermal conduction resistance of liquid thin films, but also elongates the evaporating liquid meniscus along the height direction of micro pillars. For larger contact angles of 37{\textdegree} and 63{\textdegree} for example, dry-out initiates from the heating center at a sufficiently high heat flux, leading to serious deterioration of heat transfer with expansion of the dry-out area. However, for smaller contact angle of 10{\textdegree} and 23{\textdegree}, fixed and periodical bubble nucleation appears sequentially before dry-out heat flux. At small heat fluxes, there is no obvious difference in effective heat transfer coefficient for four hydrophilic surfaces. On the other hand, considerable increase of effective heat transfer coefficient can be obtained at higher heat flux on a stronger hydrophilic surface because of the receding of the liquid film can sustain a higher dry-out heat flux, or CHF.},

An a priori cavity detection method is employed to convert raw profilometer data of a surface into well-defined cavities. The cavity information and surface morphology are represented in the CFD model by geometric mesh deformations. Surface morphology is observed to initiate buoyancy-driven convection in the liquid phase, which in turn results in faster nucleation of cavities. Simulations pertaining to a generic rough surface show a trend where smaller size cavities nucleate with higher wall superheat. This local-scale model will serve as a self-consistent connection to larger device scale continuum models where local feature representation is not possible.},

	abstract = {The present paper is an experimental investigation of roughness effects on nucleate pool boiling of refrigerant R113 on horizontal circular copper surfaces. The copper samples were treated by different sand paper grit sizes to achieve different surface roughness. The average surface roughness of the four samples was 0.901, 0.735, 0.65, and 0.09, respectively. The experiments were performed in the heat flux range of 8 to 200kW/m2. The heat transfer coefficient was calculated by measuring wall superheat of the samples and the input heat flux. The results show significant improvement of heat transfer coefficient as the surface roughness is increased. It is found that the heat transfer coefficient of the sample with Ra=0.901 is 3.4, 10.5, and 38.5\% higher in comparison with surfaces with Ra of 0.735, 0.65, and 0.09 at heat flux of 170 kW/m2. Moreover, the results are compared with literature data and the well known Cooper correlation.},

An automata model for pool boiling heat transfer is provided with rules to simulate heat transfer considering the influence of the contact angle. Free bubbles are modeled as a population of virtual spheres that change their geometric properties with simple stochastic rules. The model is validated against published experimental pool boiling data, showing excellent agreement with the boiling curve, as well as with the activation of nucleation sites, in a statistical sense. The sensitivity of the model parameters is studied to assess their influence and relevance. The model also provides information about the behavior of other near-wall relevant quantities, such as the interfacial area density and bubble detachment frequency. The computing time is around two orders of magnitude lower than the required by continuum methods to simulate pool boiling.},

Die W{\"a}rmemenge, die von einer Metalloberfl{\"a}che an siedendes Wasser {\"u}bertragen wird, nimmt mit wachsender Temperaturdifferenz $\Delta$T zu; hat dieses $\Delta$T eine bestimmte Grenze erreicht, so nimmt die W{\"a}rmemenge Q ab bei weiterhin ansteigendem $\Delta$T. Dieser Umschlagpunkt ist der Maximalwert der {\"u}bertragbaren W{\"a}rme. Das Vorhandensein dieses Punktes wurde tats{\"a}chlich experimentell beobachtet. Bei Atmosph{\"a}rendruck liegt das der maximalen W{\"a}rmestromdichte f{\"u}r Wasser von 100{\textdegree}C entsprechende $\Delta$T zwischen 20 und 40 Grad und zwischen 1080000 und 1800000 kcal/m2 h, d.h. zwischen 2000 und 3000 kg/m2 h, wenn es als konstante Dampfmassenstromdichte bei 100{\textdegree}C ausgedr{\"u}ckt wird. Diese Betr{\"a}ge sind gr{\"o}sser als die fr{\"u}her angenommene maximale W{\"a}rmestromdichte.

	abstract = {This paper establishes relations between the stability and the high-order truncated corrections for modeling of the mass conservation equation with the tworelaxation-times (TRT) collision operator. First we propose a simple method to derive the truncation errors from the exact, central-difference type, recurrence equations of the TRT scheme. They also supply its equivalent three-time-level discretization form. Two different relationships of the two relaxation rates nullify the third (advection) and fourth (pure diffusion) truncation errors, for any linear equilibrium and any velocity set. However, the two relaxation times alone cannot remove the leading-order advection-diffusion error, because of the intrinsic fourth-order numerical diffusion. The truncation analysis is carefully verified for the evolution of concentration waves with the anisotropic diffusion tensors. The anisotropic equilibrium functions are presented in a simple but general form, suitable for the minimal velocity sets and the d2Q9, d3Q13, d3Q15 and d3Q19 velocity sets. All anisotropic schemes are complemented by their exact necessary von Neumann stability conditions and equivalent finite-difference stencils. The sufficient stability conditions are proposed for the most stable (OTRT) family, which enables modeling at any Peclet numbers with the same velocity amplitude. The heuristic stability analysis of the fourth-order truncated corrections extends the optimal stability to larger relationships of the two relaxation rates, in agreement with the exact (one-dimensional) and numerical (multi-dimensional) stability analysis. A special attention is put on the choice of the equilibrium weights. By combining accuracy and stability predictions, several strategies for selecting the relaxation and free-tunable equilibrium parameters are suggested and applied to the evolution of the Gaussian hill.},

	abstract = {We analyze the intrinsic impact of free-tunable combinations of the relaxation rates controlling viscosity-independent accuracy of the multiple-relaxation-times (MRT) lattice-Boltzmann models. Preserving all MRT degrees of freedom, we formulate the parametrization conditions which enable the MRT schemes to provide viscosity-independent truncation errors for steady state solutions, and support them with the second- and third-order accurate ({\textquotedblleft}linear{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}parabolic{\textquotedblright}, respectively) boundary schemes. The parabolic schemes demonstrate the advanced accuracy with weak dependency on the relaxation rates, as confirmed by the simulations with the D3Q15 model in three regular arrays (SC, BCC, FCC) of touching spheres. Yet, the low-order, bounce-back boundary rule remains appealing for pore-scale simulations where the precise distance to the boundaries is undetermined. However, the effective accuracy of the bounce-back crucially depends on the free-tunable combinations of the relaxation rates. We find that the combinations of the kinematic viscosity rate with the available {\textquotedblleft}ghost{\textquotedblright} antisymmetric collision mode rates mainly impact the accuracy of the bounce-back scheme. As the first step, we reduce them to the one combination (presented by so-called {\textquotedblleft}magic{\textquotedblright} parameter $\Lambda$ in the frame of the two-relaxation-times (TRT) model), and study its impact on the accuracy of the drag force/permeability computations with the D3Q19 velocity set in two different, dense, random packings of 8000 spheres each. We also run the simulations in the regular (BCC and FCC) packings of the same porosity for the broad range of the discretization resolutions, ranging from 5 to 750 lattice nodes per sphere diameter. A special attention is given to the discretization procedure resulting in significantly reduced scatter of the data obtained at low resolutions. The results reveal the identical $\Lambda$-dependency versus the discretization resolution in all four packings, regular and random. While very small $\Lambda$ values overestimate the drag measurements several-fold on the coarse grids, $\Lambda${\textgreater}1 may overestimate the permeability at the same extent. In low resolution region we provide practical guidelines, extending previously known solutions for the straight/diagonal Poiseuille flow. Analysis of the high-resolution region reveals the collapse of the solutions obtained with all the considered $\Lambda$ values with the average rate of -1.3, followed by their common, smooth, first-order convergence with the rate of -1.0 as the best, towards the reference solutions provided by the {\textquotedblleft}parabolic{\textquotedblright} schemes. High-quality power-law fits estimate that the bounce-back would reach their accuracy (obtained at about 200 nodes per sphere) for two-order magnitude higher grid resolution.},

	abstract = {The application of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) in three-dimensional isothermal hydrodynamic problems often adopts one of the following models: D3Q15, D3Q19, or D3Q27. Although all of them retrieve consistent Navier{\textendash}Stokes dynamics in the continuum limit, they are expected to behave differently at discrete level. The present work addresses this issue by performing a LBM truncation error analysis. As a conclusion, it is theoretically demonstrated that differences among the aforementioned cubic lattices lie in the structure of their non-linear truncation errors. While reduced lattice schemes, such as D3Q15 and D3Q19, introduce spurious angular dependencies through non-linear truncation errors, the complete three-dimensional cubic lattice D3Q27 is absent from such features. This result justifies the superiority of the D3Q27 lattice scheme to cope with the rotational invariance principle in three-dimensional isothermal hydrodynamic problems, particularly when convection is not negligible. Such a theoretical conclusion also finds support in numerical tests presented in this work: a Poiseuille duct flow and a weakly-rotating duct flow.},

In this paper a procedure for systematic a priori derivation of the lattice Boltzmann models for non-ideal gases from the Enskog equation (the modi ed Boltzmann equation for dense gases) is presented. This treatment provides a uni ed theory of lattice Boltzmann models for non-ideal gases. The lattice Boltzmann equation is systematically obtained by discretizing the Enskog equation in phase space and time. The lattice Boltzmann model derived in this paper is thermodynamically consistent up to the order of discretization error. Existing lattice Boltzmann models for non-ideal gases are analyzed and compared in detail. Evaluation of these models are made in light of the general procedure to construct the lattice Boltzmann model for non-ideal gases presented in this work.},

Nowadays, the application of LBM ranges from the incompressible flow, flow in the porous medium, until microflows. The common collision model of LBM is the BGK with a constant single relaxation time $\tau$ . However, BGK suffers from numerical instabilities. These instabilities could be eliminated by implementing LBM with multiple relaxation time. Both of those scheme have implemented for incompressible 2 dimensions lid-driven cavity. The stability analysis has done by finding the maximum Reynolds number and velocity for converged simulations. The accuracy analysis is done by comparing the velocity profile with the benchmark results from Ghia, et al and calculating the net velocity flux. The tests concluded that LBM with MRT are more stable than BGK, and have a similar accuracy. The maximum Reynolds number that converges for BGK is 3200 and 7500 for MRT respectively.},

The new solver is based on Chapman-Enskog expansion analysis, which is the bridge to link Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations and lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE). The macroscopic differential equations are discretized by the finite volume method, where the flux at the cell interface is evaluated by local reconstruction of lattice Boltzmann solution from macroscopic flow variables at cell centers. The new solver removes the drawbacks of conventional lattice Boltzmann method such as limitation to uniform mesh, tie-up of mesh spacing and time interval, limitation to viscous flows. LBFS is validated by its application to simulate the viscous decaying vortex flow, the driven cavity flow, the viscous flow past a circular cylinder, and the inviscid flow past a circular cylinder. The obtained numerical results compare very well with available data in the literature, which show that LBFS has the second order of accuracy in space, and can be well applied to viscous and inviscid flow problems with non-uniform mesh and curved boundary.},

Simulation results confirm that the shape of saturated pool boiling curves depends greatly on the ratio of heater length (LH) to the capillary length (l0). For large heaters with LH/l0 P 12, boiling curves collapse into one and the heater can be considered to be of infinite size. For heater sizes in the range of 4 {\textless} LH/l0 {\textless} 12, the heater size has great influence on CHF, transition boiling and film boiling regimes. It was found that the CHF increases with the decreasing heater size and existing correlation equations on heater size effects on critical heat flux are valid. For small heaters with LH/l0 6 4, the transition boiling regime disappears, and the nucleate boiling mode switches to the film boiling mode immediately as the wall heat flux is increased. It is also shown that subcooling has relatively small effects in natural convection, in the nucleate boiling regime and film boiling regime, but it enhances CHF greatly and shorten the transition boiling regime. The relationship between simulated critical heat fluxes of saturated and subcooled nucleate boiling in pool boiling agrees well with existing correlation equations. {\'O} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is found that simulated boiling curves in dimensionless form under these two different heating modes are identical in nucleate boiling and film boiling regimes, and they differ only in the transition boiling regime. Saturated temperatures have relatively small effects on boiling curves up to the fullydeveloped nucleate boiling regime, but have pronounced effects on critical heat flux and on film boiling. Boiling hysteresis between increasing heating and decreasing heating are also simulated numerically. It is confirmed numerically that boiling hysteresis exists in transition boiling regime for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces under controlled wall heat flux conditions. Under controlled wall temperature conditions, however, boiling hysteresis exists only on a hydrophobic surface during decreasing heat flux but no boiling hysteresis exists on a hydrophilic surface. Rohsenow{\textquoteright}s classical correlation equation for nucleate boiling heat transfer matches well with simulated nucleate boiling heat transfer results for smooth horizontal superheated surfaces.

	abstract = {The present paper, convective dropwise condensation flow over a cold spot is numerically investigated using a 2D hybrid thermal lattice Boltzmann (LB) model with vapor-liquid phase change. After validating the present LB model, dropwise condensation on a cold spot as the nucleation region is simulated so as to study the nucleation and growth of the isolated droplet. The well-known power law for the growth of a single condensing droplet is demonstrated. And then, both simulations of dropwise condensation and convective dropwise condensation are carried out to study the effect of forced convective flow on dropwise condensation. Aiming to consider the effect of contact angle, the droplet is growing in the constant contact radius (CCR) mode. The results indicate that the forced convectional flow complicates the internal flow of the droplet and the vapor flow. The detouring flow (including the lee-side vortex) around the droplet in an isothermal system is replaced by the suction flow owing to condensation. The interaction between the dragging force of the vapor flow and the surface tension gradient changes the size of two symmetric vortices within the droplet in dropwise condensation. The size of these two vortices inside the droplet depends on the velocity and direction of convective flow. By comparison, the heat transfer enhancement of the superimposed flow is not worth mentioning in spite of different flow mode. Not affected by the vapor flow, the heat transfer is weakened by increasing of the contact angle owing to the change of conduction resistance. The present study illustrates the mechanisms of convective dropwise condensation flow in detail.},

	abstract = {The growth and departure of bubbles from an orifice and their interactions is a common phenomenon. In this paper, a multiphase flow model based on the lattice Boltzmann method is constructed to study this process, with an improved interface capture method being adopted to deal with the high density ratio between liquid and gas. A virtual layer is added outside the computational domain to handle the boundary condition at the orifice. The processes of bubble formation and interaction are well simulated by the model, and the results agree well with those of theoretical calculations for single-bubble formation and departure diameter and period. Bubble formation is controlled by the inertial force of the gas, buoyancy, surface tension, and the viscous force of the liquid. The inertial force of the gas and buoyancy promote bubble growth and departure, respectively, while the surface tension controls bubble deformation and the viscous force affects the necking process. Increases in both the orifice size and the gas outflow velocity can enlarge the departure diameter of the bubble, but the orifice size plays a more important role here. Both of these two parameters have obvious effects on the departure period. For the interaction of bubbles growing from orifices with the same or different sizes, different coalescence categories are distinguished according to the stage of coalescence, and the characteristics of the coalescence process are considered in terms of their dependence on surface tension, viscous force, and buoyancy. Finally, the departure diameter and departure period of coalesced bubbles are studied under the different coalescence conditions.},

The SHSLBM is a recently developed scheme within lattice Boltzmann framework, which utilizes lattice properties and relationships given by Chapman-Enskog expansion analysis to reconstruct solutions of macroscopic governing equations recovered from lattice Boltzmann equation and resolved in a predictor-corrector scheme. Formulations of original SHSLBM are slightly adjusted in the present work to facilitate implementation on body-fitted mesh. The boundary treatment proposed in this paper offers an analytical approach to interpret no-slip boundary condition, and the stability analysis in this paper fixes flaws in previous works and reveals a very nice stability characteristic in high Reynolds number scenarios. Several benchmark tests are conducted for comprehensive evaluation of the boundary treatment and numerical validation of stability analysis. It turns out that by adopting the modifications suggested in this work, lower numerical error can be expected.},

We integrate the interaction forces, simulated by pseudopotentials, into two on-site boundary conditions: standard bounce-back (SBB) and Zou and He (ZH) [12] to determine the distribution functions of the boundary nodes. Three different interaction forces are tested: pseudopotential-based interaction ($\psi$), modified pseudopotential-based interaction (m$\psi$), and a ZH-based interaction, which is proposed by this study based on the ZH method. Therefore, the schemes are $\psi$-SBB, m$\psi$-SBB, m$\psi$-ZH, and ZH-ZH. The first criterion is the achievement of macroscopic Poiseuille flow. The second criterion is the achievement of a wide range of contact angles. The main method of simulation is multipseudopotential interaction [30]. It is found that the scheme of $\psi$-SBB creates a relatively large fluctuation of density across the channel. Whilst, the schemes of m$\psi$-SBB, m$\psi$-ZH, and ZH-ZH generate much less density variation across the channel. Among them, ZH-ZH treatment is superior based on density fluctuation and the error associated with the resolution, relaxation time, and compressibility. We found that all four boundary conditions can form a wide of range of contact angles. The $\psi$-SBB scheme creates largest density fluctuation inside a drop on wettable surfaces. The schemes of m$\psi$-SBB and m$\psi$-ZH create almost the same density fluctuation which is larger than ZH-ZH. Moreover, m$\psi$ interaction generates spurious velocities as high as six times a free drop with SBB and eight times with ZH while spurious velocities in $\psi$-SBB and ZH-ZH are very close to the free drop. Therefore, ZH-ZH performs best, also, in wettability tests.},

A comparison of the numerical simulation achievements on the basis of density ratios and spurious currents is used for presentation of the details of phase separation in these non-ideal single-component systems. The paper demonstrates that the scheme for the inter-particle interaction force term as well as the force term incorporation method matters to achieve more accurate and stable results. The velocity shifting method is demonstrated as the force term incorporation method, among many, with accuracy and stability results. Kupershtokh scheme also makes it possible to achieve large density ratio (up to 10 ) and to reproduce the coexistence curve with high accuracy. Significant reduction of the spurious currents at vapor-liquid interface is another observation.
